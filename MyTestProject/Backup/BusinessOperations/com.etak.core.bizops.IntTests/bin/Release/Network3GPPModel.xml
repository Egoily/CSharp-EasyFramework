            This service provides the means by which the MS may indicate the charge that will be made for the use of telecommunication services. 
            It is intended for applications where the user is generally not the subscriber but is known to the subscriber, and where the 
            user pays the subscriber, rather than the TypeOfBarring Provider.
            The charge information is based as closely as possible on the charge that will be levied on 
            the subscriber's bill in the Home PLMN. Where this charge cannot be stored in the MS, 
            use of the telecommunications service shall be prevented as described below.

            This supplementary service provides for the ability to indicate the name information of the calling party to the called party at call set-up time for all incoming calls.

            However, the delivery of the calling name to the called party may be affected by other services subscribed to by the calling party. 
            For example, if the calling party has subscribed to Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR), 
            then the calling line identity  as well as the calling name identity shall not be presented to the called party.
